## Informational Tips:

Virtual machines take up a lot of resources, which sparked the invention of
containers.  The idea is analogous to shipping containers.  Before shipping
containers were invented, manufacturers had to ship goods in a wide variety
of sizes, packaging, and modes (trucks, trains, ships).

By standardizing the shipping container, these goods could be transferred
between different shipping methods without any modification.  The same 
idea applies to software containers.

Containers are a lightweight unit of code and its runtime dependencies, 
packaged in a standardized way, so they can quickly be plugged in and run
on the Linux OS.  You don't need to create a whole virtual operating 
system, as you would with a virtual machine.

Containers only replicate parts of the operating system they need in order
to work.  This reduces their size and gives them a big performance boost.

**Docker** is currently the leading container platform, and it's even able
to run Linux containers on Windows and macOS.  To create a Docker
container, you need a Docker image.  Images provide blueprints for 
containers much like classes provide blueprints for objects.
